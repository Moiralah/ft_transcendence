# Chapter II — Preamble

First of all, congratulations on reaching this milestone! You are now entering the final project of your Common Core, and yes, it will not be easy.

Transcendence is a group project (4-5 people), which is intended to boost your creativity, self-confidence, adaptability to new technologies, and teamwork skills. You'll create a real-world web application as a team that can move in many directions, depending on the modules you choose and the choices you make. Make sure to think things through together as a team before you start.

The project is divided into two parts:

- The **mandatory part**, which is the fixed core of the project to which every team member must contribute.
- A set of **modules**, which you can choose and which count toward the final grade.

This is a long group project. Poor early choices and lack of team coordination will cost a lot of time. Your project and team management will strongly impact your results. All team members must actively participate and contribute to both the mandatory part and the modules.

## II.1 Team Organization and Project Management

As this is a group project, proper team organization is crucial for success. You must establish clear roles and responsibilities from the start.

### II.1.1 Required Team Roles

Your team must assign the following roles (one person can have multiple roles if the team has 4 members):

- **Product Owner (PO):** Defines the product vision, prioritizes features, and ensures the project meets user needs.
  - Maintains the product backlog
  - Makes decisions on features and priorities
  - Validates completed work
  - Communicates with stakeholders (evaluators, peers)

- **Project Manager (PM) / Scrum Master:** Facilitates team coordination and removes obstacles.
  - Organizes team meetings and planning sessions
  - Tracks progress and deadlines
  - Ensures team communication
  - Manages risks and blockers

- **Technical Lead / Architect:** Oversees technical decisions and architecture.
  - Defines technical architecture
  - Makes technology stack decisions
  - Ensures code quality and best practices
  - Reviews critical code changes

- **Developers (all team members):** Implement features and modules.
  - Write code for assigned features
  - Participate in code reviews
  - Test their implementations
  - Document their work

**Team Size:**

- **4 people:** Some members will have multiple roles (e.g., PM + Developer, PO + Developer).
- **5 people:** Roles can be more specialized, with dedicated PO, PM, Tech Lead, and 2 Developers.

All roles must be clearly documented in your `README.md`.

### II.1.2 Recommended Project Management Practices

While not mandatory, we strongly recommend implementing some basic project management practices to help your team succeed:

- **Regular communication:** Meet regularly (weekly or bi-weekly) to sync on progress and blockers.
- **Task organization:** Use simple tools like GitHub Issues, Trello, or even a shared document to track who does what.
- **Work breakdown:** Divide the project into smaller, manageable tasks.
- **Code reviews:** Try to have at least one other team member review important code changes.
- **Documentation:** Keep notes of important decisions and how things work.
- **Communication channel:** Use Discord, Slack, or similar for quick team communication.

These practices are recommendations to help you organize your work. Find what works best for your team! The important thing is that everyone contributes and the work is well-coordinated.

During evaluation, the team will be asked to explain:

- How roles were distributed.
- How work was organized and divided.
- How you communicated and coordinated as a team.
- How each member contributed to the project.

All team members must be able to explain the project and their contributions.

# Chapter III — Mandatory Part

The project content is up to you. Yes, you have to bring your own ideas and decide together what application to build as a team.

It's a step forward from what you did previously in the Common Core. You need to think about the project as a whole, not just the features you're going to implement.

Of course, you won't be completely free—there are constraints—but the idea is yours.

## III.1 What are we doing?

First, you will have to create a comprehensive `README.md` file. The detailed requirements for the README are specified in the **README Requirements** section at the end of this document.

**Project Examples**

Your project can take many forms. Here are some valid examples:

- A multiplayer Pong game with tournament system
- A collaborative platform with real-time features
- A social network with user interactions
- An online game (Chess, Tic-Tac-Toe, etc.) with matchmaking
- A project management application
- Any other creative web application that meets the requirements

The key is to create something engaging that demonstrates your technical skills and creativity.

## III.2 General Requirements

Building an entire project is complicated, and many things can go wrong. To help you, we will provide a list of general requirements that you must follow. If you don't follow them, your project will be rejected.

The requirements are the following:

- The project must be a web application, and requires a frontend, backend, and a database.
- Git must be used with clear and meaningful commit messages. The repository must show:
  - Commits from all team members.
  - Clear commit messages describing the changes.
  - Proper work distribution across the team.
- Deployment must use a containerization solution (Docker, Podman, or equivalent) and run with a single command.
- Your website must be compatible with the latest stable version of Google Chrome.
- No warnings or errors about the JavaScript code should appear in the browser console.
- The project must include accessible Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages with relevant content.

**Privacy Policy and Terms of Service**

These pages will be verified during evaluation. They must:

- Be easily accessible from the application (e.g., footer links).
- Contain relevant and appropriate content for your project.
- Not be placeholder or empty pages. Missing or inadequate Privacy Policy/Terms of Service pages will result in project rejection.

**Multi-user Support (Mandatory)**

Your website must support multiple users simultaneously. This is a core requirement of the project. Users should be able to interact with the application at the same time without conflicts or performance issues.

This includes:

- Multiple users can be logged in and active at the same time.
- Concurrent actions by different users are handled properly.
- Real-time updates are reflected across all connected users when applicable.
- No data corruption or race conditions occur with simultaneous user actions.

## III.3 Technical Requirements

This section, like the previous one, is mandatory. You will then be able to choose the modules you want to use in the next chapter.

- A frontend that is clear, responsive, and accessible across all devices.
- Use a CSS framework or styling solution of your choice (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Material-UI, Styled Components, etc.).
- Store credentials (API keys, environment variables, etc.) in a local `.env` file that is ignored by Git, and provide an `.env.example` file.
- The database must have a clear schema and well-defined relations.
- Your application must have a basic user management system. Users must be able to sign up and log in securely:
  - At minimum: email and password authentication with proper security (hashed passwords, salted, etc.).
  - Additional authentication methods (OAuth, 2FA, etc.) can be implemented via modules.
- All forms and user inputs must be properly validated in both the frontend and backend.
- Any connection to the backend, from a browser, from a script, from an external API, etc., must use HTTPS. Connections inside the backend itself (e.g., web server and database, software inside your container(s)) can be without encryption.

**What is a Framework?**

For this project, a framework is defined as a comprehensive tool that provides:

- A structured architecture and conventions for organizing code.
- Built-in features for common tasks (routing, state management, etc.).
- A complete ecosystem of tools and libraries.

Examples:

- **Frontend frameworks:** React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Next.js (these are frameworks).
- **Backend frameworks:** Express, Fastify, NestJS, Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails.
- **Not frameworks:** jQuery (library), Lodash (utility library), Axios (HTTP client).

> **Note:** React is considered a framework in this context due to its ecosystem and architectural patterns, even though it is technically a library.

# Chapter IV — Modules

You will need to earn **14 points** in total to complete your project. Each **major** module is worth **2 points**, and each **minor** module is worth **1 point**.

The following categories are available. You may choose multiple modules from any category:

- Web
- Accessibility and Internationalization
- User Management
- Artificial Intelligence
- Cybersecurity
- Gaming and User Experience
- DevOps
- Data and Analytics
- Blockchain
- Modules of Choice

We strongly recommend choosing modules only after your ideas are clear and you have a good understanding of what you want to build.

Additionally, aiming for more than 14 points in total may be a good idea, especially if some modules aren't validated during the evaluation.

**Important — Module Dependencies and Evaluation:**

- Some modules require other modules to be implemented first (marked with info notes).
- Gaming modules (AI Opponent, Tournament, Game customization, Spectator mode, Multiplayer 3+, Add another game) require that at least one game be implemented first.
- The Game Statistics module requires that a game be implemented.
- Advanced chat features require the basic chat functionality from the "User interaction" module.
- SSR is incompatible with the ICP blockchain backend.
- Plan your modules carefully to ensure they work together coherently!
